        Most of my interest are focused around developing my skills of gathering, processing and analysing information.
        This is why I went to study mathematics and chose to learn software developement. I also do not despise other intelectual pursuits like:
        a game of chess, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)'>set</a>,
        an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube'>interesting puzzle</a>,
        a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torment:_Tides_of_Numenera'>computer game</a>,
        a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash'>book</a>,
        or a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery'>movie</a>.
        I have created this page to write down the notes I have produced during my pursuits.
